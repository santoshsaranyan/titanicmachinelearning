# Prediction of survivors aboard the titanic
Repository for the Titanic survivors machine learning project

• Applied the Random Forest machine learning model in Python on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict
whether a person aboard the Titanic survived or not.

• Determined that a person’s survival aboard the Titanic depended largely on factors such as their gender, age, and
ticket class.
